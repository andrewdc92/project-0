/* main thoughts here: NOT setting up bootstrap? have to decide if committing to
container/row/column format is best. thinking if the <canvas> is set centered,
navigating "freely" within it shouldn't be an issue

-Create "tracks" in html for icons(players) to move across ->bootstrap? good here
-First step forward in the pseudo- YES to bootstrap?
